## Vulnerability Description

Tenda AC10V4.0 si_V16.03.10.13_cn_TDC01 were discovered to contain a stack overflow via the mac parameter in the GetParentControlInfo function.

## Vulnerability Details

In function GetParentControlInfo line 35, it reads in a user-provided parameter, and the variable is passed to the function without any length check, which may lead to overflow of the stack-based buffer. As a result, by requesting the page, an attacker can easily execute a denial of service attack or remote code execution.
